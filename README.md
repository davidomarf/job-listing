# Guide to Angular Testing

This is a front-end project in Angular 9 to show my team's workflow to test our
components and services.

I'd love this to be helpful to anyone trying to:

- Learn what to test in front-end projects,
- integrate tests into an existing Angular codebase, or
- start using TDD for new features.

The UI and UX for this project was taken from Frontend Mentors' [Job Listings
with filtering][frontend-mentor].
